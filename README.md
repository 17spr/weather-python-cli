# weather-python-cli
A command line app that fetches a location's current weather description using an API. 

***This app was built following Dan Bader's tutorial at https://dbader.org/blog/python-commandline-tools-with-click***

This is a CLI tool that fetches weather data. It is built in Python and utilizes the Click and Requests libraries.
After building this application, I learned more about...
**Decorators in Python**
**APIs**
**Command Line Interfaces**
**Click library**
**Adding mandatory command line arguments to scripts**
